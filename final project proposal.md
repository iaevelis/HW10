# Arduino touch sensor piano

A physical keyboard that operates by touching certain conductive components. When a key is touched, an accordinate LED light shines. 

## Summary

This musical instrument is a physical keyboard simulator that allows user to interact with it. User will be able to know which pitch they played by LED indicators. keys are made by conductive materials, thus the user does not need to press anything, instead, all they need to do is to touch the desired 'keys' to play music.

## Component Parts

wood blocks: base.;
aluminium or iron nails: conductive parts;
arduino and other electronic parts (provided);
extra breadboards and LEDs;

inputs: finger touch the conductive parts to indicate a keyboard press;
output: sound and LED light;
data: musical pitch;

## Challenges

Building the hardware part and to make sure the keys are correspondent to the signals; 
coding; 
finish everything on time. 

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: prepare all the materials
- Week 3: hardware building done, coding start
- Week 4: finish coding
- Week 5: Present!
